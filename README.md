Dimension-Comparison-App
========================

Backbone app to compare, edit update and create new instances of database dimensions/records.
This enables end users to open, close and delete database dimensions which are used for calculations, lookups, information and reporting in various other systems.

Due to working with legacy backend systems, I have overridden Model and Sync to provide non RESTfull persistence to classic asp backend.
